The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture of Tobias Laemmle. Write a detailed summary about the given topics.

TRANSCRIPT:

which I didn't, which I wouldn't have if I would have met plot lib create a limit by itself. So that's why we're doing that. Okay, it gives you just another opportunity to customize the plot like you want to, you want it to look like. So, everything clear, I, any problems or. Am I too fast. Okay. So. Then what else we have the logarithmic. No, it's okay. Some data. Lens itself well to logarithmic scaling on one of its axis or maybe on both. Man, but it handles that also very nice. It even adds a second set of smaller ticks. You see here without any labels and these are called minor ticks. So they help the fewer just resolve locations. So minor ticks will be showing up again later examples as well. So fine control over ticks. It just can make the story of plot tells crisper by default. They sit just outside the plot frame, but you can place the ticks inside the frame or halving or halved out as as you like. To adjust this aspect of tick behavior, we get to use the tick parents method. So everything we do with major ticks can also be done with minor ticks as well. Just just to know that. The. Yeah. So here. We set the. X axis ticks in. So they appear inside our graph. And we set the y axis ticks in out in out means they are between in and out. And we don't know on the y axis. That's that that was it. That is what in out means in this case. Okay, by default. I hope you can do this with major ticks, but also with minor ticks as well. But the default value is major ticks. So if you want to do this with minor ticks, you have to specify it here. By default ticks and labels will always be added to the left and the bottom. So that's the default value. And to change this, you just use the tick parents. Okay, here for the accesses and here for the y axis. The bowling arguments. Bottom top right. And left determined whether the ticks are shown. And left guess tick labels are similarly controlled using label bottom label top label left label right and you can have one without the other or you can have both or either of any axis or any combination you would like. Sometimes if your taste is particular, the default text just aren't quite right. So you can even adjust the length with all the color of your ticks as well. Just another set of parameters and they're called will flanks and they are measured in points. And for color also every color that you can imagine is possible. So this looks quite weird, but whatever you like. In the section of our text, we saw you can customize access label and plot text in the way, but we stopped short of showing how to handle tick labels. So now we are finally get to that as well. As you can see, this gives you a fair amount of power or over your tick labels. That's because when the access our first created method, it makes a reasonable guess at how much space the ticks and access labels are going to take and places the plot accordingly. So in this case, it was too less space so you don't see the numbers at the bottom. So that's a great illustration of how sometimes we will need to take the access layout and draw our own hats, just one example of that. And last thing, when we got minor ticks for free, we got minor ticks for free as we used the lock scale. But if we want to add minor scales to linear scales, we can we can do that as well to do this. We have to introduce the notion of a locator. It's a function that generates the locations according to some rules you specify. And there are several different types, but outer locators are great place to start day because they automatically create a reasonable set of ticks. By default, major ticks are initialized with an outer locator, but minor ticks unfortunately aren't so to turn them on, we have to import the outer. So minor locator and then use it to set the minor ticks for the X and Y axis. And that will look something like this. Another powerful tool is called the formator and it's a function that lets you transform the tick labels to be an integer, a fixed decimal or lots of other things. First, we import it and then use it to create tick labels using just the coordinates of each tick itself. The helpful package that contains all the formators and locators is called ticker. And again, if your crew is about it, there's lots of details in the API and I will put up a link in the resources to. So the final thing is, which is called the cousin of the tick and it's called the grid. And the grids are basically tick lines across the entire plot. These want to pretty easy to create and you just have to use the grid command. Also, it defaults to making both X and Y grids lines. You can also handle them individually in your code as well, if you'd like to. It takes all the arguments that we could pass the plot and when we were formatting a line, so there's nothing special to that. So after the complexity of ticks, it's a pretty straightforward way to make your plots stylish and readable. So do we have anything? So that's basically all the things you can control with map plot lib. So basically everything. I know that was quite a lot. Again, it's not that you know all the stuff and all know how everything is style or customized. So just to give you advance what is possible with we've mapped out lib and then you have a kind of resource where you can where you can look up all these things. If you if you have the need to customize. I would suggest you do a couple of more exercises. I provided one for the for the markers and one for the ticks. And there's also a bonus exercise just if you want to. If you think the other exercise is a bit too easier if you're more advanced. There's a bonus exercise with with pangins I had for I think from GitHub. That one is pretty complicated, but if you if you'd like to just take a look at the bonus exercise and I will post the solution to this. And in all blackboard as well. So yeah, I think I will do that right after the lesson. So I would suggest quickly go to another breakout session to a couple


GIVEN TOPICS:

-Using PlotLib to customize plots
-Different types of locators and formatters
-Creating grids


DETAILED SUMMARY:


==========

PlotLib is a powerful tool for customizing plots. There are different types of locators and formatters which can be used to control the appearance of ticks and labels. The grid command can be used to create tick lines across the entire plot.
