The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture. Make a list of the main topics discussed in this transcript.

TRANSCRIPT:

the reason why so many machine learning projects fail or never go with the production at all and as this is so important I really try to explain this once more with an analogy to make it even more clear so imagine you're trying to train the dog okay so to do that the first thing you need to know is what is the goal of our training do you need a dog for hurting your sheep do you need a dog for chasing criminals or do you need a dog for winning contests because what might be considered a good behavior for a police dog like I don't know chasing somebody and then bite him in the leg maybe isn't so much for a dog in a contest right so let's say you decided you needed a dog for hurting your flock of sheep and when he's able to keep the herd together you consider that as good behavior only then you start thinking about where you can get all the data and with training methods make sense to try to train to teach him and exactly that like for example do I have enough looking sheep to show him what a sheep is in the first place and I like this picture to visualize how important it is to start with a clear goal in mind so now back to our support vector machine and the right candidates we have already seen it ain't possible to find a solution that is 100% right every time but as I said what is what is worse inviting the wrong person to an interview or miss out the right person from interview because for a computer to make this decision it needs a quality measure if we stick with the analogy of the dog the quality measure decides whether the dog receives it read on a like police dog by thief in the leg good boy sheep dog by sheep in the leg bad boy I'll give you another example where the definition of a completely wrong quality measure lets needs to let's say improvable results so can you imagine what this is trying to be I didn't find a really good picture of it anybody nope okay I love your hint exactly alright that's supposed to be a vacuum cleaner vacuum robot so actually this vacuum robot was called phantom and for his owner he was working way too slow so what did he do he mounted a small computer on top of it as you do and it traded with a machine learning model and the goal was it was supposed to a vacuum faster and be watch out for furniture in his way so its quality measure was high when it drove really really fast and low when it bumped into things which his front sensors would report to him can you guess the result and keep in mind the system always looks for the easiest way to solve a problem like the cheapest way to get the highest score what do you think happened did it work of course it didn't work the result was phantom speed it backwards through the whole flat with lightning speed and it bumped into everything that was in his way why plain simple phantom didn't have any sensors in the back so as far as phantom was concerned no sensors no collisions so I know that's kind of funny example that should only prove once more that a really really small mistake a little callusness can lead to completely useless solutions and by the way phantom trained his or his owner trained phantom using neural network which will will take a deeper look in one of our upcoming lectures and just to try from the point another example just to make it really really clear why this is so important in machine learning so again you see I'm not the best drawer but this is supposed to be a parking lot so imagine you're running a company with a big big office and a huge parking lot in front of your office it is so huge it has a total space or it has a total of 1000 spaces and on any given point in time there are 10 free spaces on average you now want to put up a sign outside showing how many empty parking spaces you have right now so you put up cameras and you use a machine learning model to check if a car is parking in the space or not and as a quality measure you choose accuracy and you should for let's say 95% accuracy I will explain accuracy in in more detail on the next slide but for now of the students made how many were correct that is accuracy so again what do you think will happen and keep in mind what is the easiest way for the model to reach at least 95% accuracy as anybody any idea do you think it will work and there will be less free spaces I'll give you a minute to think about it okay I'll tell you the answer and you might have already guessed it won't work at all because the model will most likely tell you all spaces are full anytime why because imagine at any given point in time I said there are 10 free spaces meaning when the model tells you it's full it makes a total of 10 mistakes and 10 mistakes out of 1000 is an accuracy of 99% and that sure beats my requirement which are set of 995% which will eventually lead to 90 parking lot so that's but not enough of the examples okay so going back to our problem choosing the right candidates who will get invited to the job interview and who not let's think about a good quality measure for this kind of problem so the red line is the one we already see before that makes a total of four mistakes right here I'll put a red circle around the four mistakes so 13 have been successfully hired and 14 candidates have been rejected so when I add up all correct decisions 23 divided by a total of 27 I end up with 85% and this number is called the accuracy of all decisions made 85% were correct sounds pretty simple and straightforward right however oftentimes accuracy isn't a very good quality measure as we have just seen like imagine a company like Google or Emerson for instance a company that receives way more than a thousand times more applications than they have open-breaking jobs so an HR manager could not hire a single person and have an accuracy of 99% anyway because for 99 of those 1000 applications he was right and for this reason there are more than 25 different quality measures out there and it really depends on the situation at hand which one is right and that's
