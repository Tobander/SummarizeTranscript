The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture. Make a list of the main topics discussed in this transcript.

TRANSCRIPT:

people's lives like the compass algorithm we saw in the beginning or like the outer part of the car. They really should be treated with extreme caution. It should be totally comprehensible why the system has made a certain decision to exclude something like this generation. It should also be clear which algorithm has been used which quality measurements optimize and what kind of data has been used for training. To give you an example, I think it is so important we take two different use cases that use exactly the same algorithm on optimize the model for exactly the same quality measure. Just think with all what we already know let's say we use a support vector machine or is our algorithm and we want to identify as much bad behavior as possible. Our first use case is again identifying criminals and our second use case is identifying spam email spam. I'm sure as you all know from experience I guess sometimes you're waiting for an email for hours just to realize it has gone to your span forward so that's the this one here. No big deal right the SVM just made a simple error however imagine making the same mistake in the first use case. Because this and somebody innocent to prison and I just think it is important to think about these conscious lenses before we go into any of our different parts and algorithms of machine learning. So with that out of the way let's dive right into machine learning and let's first take a look what is lying ahead of us in our upcoming five lectures. So we will start with mat.lib and visualization and I think that will be that will be enough for today. I would suggest we make let's say five minute break that all right so we're back at our past two everybody everybody okay with that. Okay perfect so see you in five minutes. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you so I'm back again. I hope you're still fresh and excited for our second part first of all any questions about about the slides or about anything in general. I can help you with I hope it wasn't too much I know it was it was a lot of slides just all with but as I said I just wanted to bring bring this this point really across why why I think it's so important to to answer those questions before you go into anything more detailed in machine learning. But now we will do some more practical stuff and we also do a couple more breaks just just to do stuff this and we will do a couple more things. All right so how we start I heard and you correct me if I'm wrong you already have an introduction to python is that correct. Yes. Okay so don't worry we don't do heavy coding but just just you know just so I know you've already seen some code and you already used an editor so because I will I will stick with the basics but I can't repeat the basic stuff how to run python but I thought as you just had your lectures I guess in the in the first weeks of 2022 I saw that's a good idea to start with some some coding as it's still fresh in your mind. And I'm sure you already noticed that the power of python lies in its various libraries that are so easy to use and one of those libraries is called met plot lip and what it is it is basically used to visualize data. And why is that so important as I said it's often one of the first steps in machine learning to kind of get a first impression what you're actually working with. And because normally you have a lot really a lot of data it's more easier to comprehend it if you can visualize it first and that's why we start with met plot lip. However before we get started I would suggest that you have an editor ready where you can run some python code because this way you can follow me along as I'm going through examples and you also do some exercises and you can run the code on your own computer in parallel. I'm sure you already realized that this way it's much easier to not coding. We also do some some breakout sessions where where we'll do the examples I've provided on blackboard and I will check on you in each room. So I'm going to you're totally free to use whatever editor you want to but I quickly introduced the editor I'm using so you see where how the idea looks like and it is called spider. I provided some download instructions on blackboard so if you haven't had the chance to install it or if you don't like to use it or if you technically weren't able to there's also a spider online version. Just go to the window link I posted in a manual. I don't know if anybody has already tried to start it because it will take a couple minutes if you use the window because a virtual environment has to be created first and if you do this the first time it really takes I don't know to three or four minutes. You can use that as well if you don't like to install anything on the computer but it looks basically the same it's just a little bit slower. So when everybody is ready that's basically all the requirements we need to start and we are ready to do some coding samples with my plot lib and basically the structure we are going to do this is. To some theory I don't know to three slides let's say plotting a line or drawing a scatter plot and then we do an exercise on on spin afterwards so either I'm showing you the exercise on my screen and you can follow along or we do a quick break out sessions where you can do the coding in your on your own. Okay perfect any questions as anybody trouble using an editor at all. Okay that's that perfect. There was my main worry. So I'm going back to the slides share my screen and afterwards I'm going to share my spider so again if you have trouble seeing either off the two then just give me a hint in the chat. So let me quickly open up the chat okay so everybody able to see the slides. Yes. Okay perfect. So that's wider that's map plot lib. So part of map plot lib it is is a simplified interface and the interface is called a pipeline. That the pipeline basically doesn't require to know anything about the inner of the
