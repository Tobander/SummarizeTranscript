TRANSCRIPT:

citizens again so actually that sounds totally reasonable so why does the success rate of this algorithm is so low it's actually barely 25% so what I'm trying to say is if somebody is presenting the awesome results of this machine learning model to you you should always critically check the quality of the predictions and not just take them blindly for granted of course there are lots and lots of greatest examples of machine learning models and applications that do great things but it is not a magical machine where you just put in lots of data on one end and I'll come to perfectly reasonable and good decision on the other like in this picture here quite the opposite is the case because in order for model to make good predictions humans have to make a lot of important decisions and a lot of parameters first and that's actually a good thing because that means we as humans aren't completely at the mercy of those machines but we can contribute into decision-making process and that is exactly what we're doing right now we will take a look under this hood and put ourselves in the position of an algorithm to make such decisions let's say you're in a job interview and maybe you know from the get-go this is going nowhere wouldn't it be great to find out exactly those characteristics that are responsible for a candidate to succeed in an interview just by looking at the candidates that were successful in the past and then build a machine learning model to find exactly candidates like that 100% objective zero discrimination and without doing five or 10 rounds of interviews sounds good let's try exactly that here you can see 27 job candidates for you 13 of them were successfully employed that's the green ones yeah the smiling ones and they stayed at least two years in the company and the other 14 candidates they were entire that's the the sad looking gray ones so these were the unsuccessful candidates looking at this diagram you see that there were two characteristics responsible for the decision first the number of years someone has been unemployed and second the number of years of experience on the job let's try some here um maybe you have printed out this this picture if you have seen it on blackboard well otherwise it's totally fine to just imagine a line or take a ruler or pen just try to make a line in this diagram to separate successful from unsuccessful candidates the line can be sliding upwards and can be sliding downwards left right right to left it doesn't matter it just has to be a line and no worry there is no idea of no right solution you can't make a mistake just try to put yourself in the shoes like let's say you're the head of HR how would you decide where would you draw the line okay I'll give you maybe a couple minutes um just to think about it and then I'll show you some of my lines and you can pay your solutions okay okay was everybody able to draw a line all right I would get most of you choose a line um and again I said there's no right solution but something along those lines here because there's no ideal solution there's also no line that makes fewer than form mistakes can you can you see the form mistakes so the this one and the line we both make form mistakes and there's there's no line that that makes fewer basically what we just did is we have trained an algorithm called support vector machine short SVM and this is a perfectly natural task for computer because most of the time there's way more than just two characteristics to take into consideration with this algorithm or line you are able to immediately tell about a new candidate if she will be successful or not if she's on the upper side on off the line you should hire and if she's done here you don't hire her there are other algorithms you can use for this task like maybe decision tree which will separate the candidates like this or even a neural network if you like to if you have the power which will the separate the candidates like this the difference is just how they split the data to find the best solution but for now we'll we'll stick with the way easier SVM so let's put this to a test just remember your line we have now a new candidate marked by the X and she has 5.5 years of experience and a total of four years of unemployment think back to your line would you hire her or not how many of you would have hired her just type in higher or not higher oh okay wow and it's pretty clear results so but again just for fun yeah exactly exactly now but I guess if you ask this if you take the same data and ask this with different groups of people they tend to make different results I guess most of you have as you all most of you hired her put put the line very very close to the bottom where I don't know maybe someone at Google or Amazon would have put the line way higher so yeah that's that's all we write a groups are biased for sure with these kinds of questions and that is often a problem so before we start training a model you should define explicitly what a good decision is what is a good result for you how should it look like and only then you should start thinking about where you get the data to train your model which algorithm you want to use and how the model should look like okay so the first thing is always answering the question how does success look to you so all the way to the right the further the right number one prediction that is the first step we we need to do in our example with the higher on prospects do you want to get as many candidates as possible and therefore risks to get some candidates that don't really fit your profile or your company culture or do you just want to get candidates that fit your profile 100% but therefore risk to in don't invite prospects that would have been a good fit and only then only then you start looking for data to train your model and you start looking for a KPI to check how good it is working to fulfill the requirements and this aspect is really really important and often
