The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture. Make a list of the main topics discussed in this transcript.

TRANSCRIPT:

but have some normally distributed random noise added to them that's what this function in the back is doing. Before we then plot each of the points describe by our X and Ys and we display the result on screen and that should look something like this that's a pretty nice scatter plot and with just this little bit of map plot with in like I don't know 10 minutes you already know enough to be dangerous okay so back to the editor and let's try to draw a scatter plot as well. So just deleting this and again we use a little space this time only minus one and one and then we create Y values using our X values but we add some random noise to them using the normal function. And the size of our X values. Okay so now we have the data really again. Right now we don't have to initialize the figure again you can do this but you don't have to so we can skip the figure method and just call. scatter the method scatter is for growing scatter plot and we hand over again our X and Y values finally going it on screen. And that should look something like the picture in the slides. Once again you have to tell me if I should should wait for you to write the code otherwise I will just wait a couple a couple of seconds so you can recreate it and tell me if you have problems. Again don't go into much about this stuff here that's just to create really fake data and use what I'm using this is I want to create Y values that are similar to the X values here this is minus one and I don't want to have. The Y values the exact same value but there should be a little bit different and that's why we're using this this here. The map plot lid stuff is just here calling the scatter method to tell my plot to pay I want to draw scatter plot using my X and Y values. Okay so back to the slides. So oftentimes you don't want to create fake data but you want to take data from a file and there are really tons of ways to do this but I'll just show you one one or two of them one of the most often used method at least. And this is the built in CSV model to load CSV files because most of the big data files are CSV files again as you might have guessed you need to import the library first so that's the import CSV. And we use a sample file I've provided on blackboard which you need to download in order to import it. And then we use the CSV model reader to read in the data and it automatically splits the file by line and then the data in the file by the limit of each of which is which is I think it's the same color yeah. Just a quick note the CSV model and the CSV reader they don't require your file to be a little bit really a CSV file basically can be any text file which is still limited. So once we've done this we store the elements within index of zero so that's our first column the month column to the X list and restore the elements within index of one to our wireless so all the temperatures. After this we all sent and we are ready to plot and show the data. So back to the editor. So first thing is I need to import CSV as we're going to use the CSV reader next thing because I guess you you had that in your lectures. You need to initialize to empty lists because I want to read in the data into lists and these lists must already exist so I'm going to initialize to empty lists using this syntax so I have a X list which is empty and I have a wireless which is empty. OK, so then I'm going to read in the temperature file and that's where the this this pane here in spider comes in handy because I can just if you have downloaded the downloaded the file it is called temperature use CSV. You can save it anywhere on your hard drive and when you then go to the file in spider you can just right click on and copy the whole path. So you don't need to know where the file is and paste it anywhere here. OK, and then we have one parameter which is called R which is simply telling saying I just want to be the file I don't want to modify or execute it all stands for read. And it's a CSV file. Oh, what is that? Sorry. OK, maybe. OK, and it's too big. Is that all right? Can you can follow me along? All right, so now I'm going to read in the file using a function called reader and it's a CSV file and my delimiter is a semi call. OK. And then I'm going to use a follow to go through all the data and each time I'm going through it I'm pending a new values. So to append use the pen function and because that's not the same, the map look lib doesn't know that it's numerical values I have to use the infunction to convert it into numerical values. And I'm telling and hey, all the values in row zero, which is the, which was the month column. And I do the same with the Y values. So a bit more of the line 14 please. Yeah, sure. I think you have to zoom out a little bit. OK. I also made a typing mistake. Sorry about that. OK. OK. So once again, first thing initialize two empty lists X and Y because we want to load in our year data into X and our temperatures into Y. Then we need to tell the model where is our data, our file that's here and it's a readable file and it's a CSV file. Then we write all the values, which are limited by a semicolon in a variable called plots. And then we write a follow, which is going through this variable. And each time we append a new data. After we converted it into numbers. So that's again, I'm it's really about here loading in the data and has nothing to do with map plot lib. So it's just basic, Python stuff. And if you haven't done this, don't grow it too much. You can save this and use it every time you load in new CSV files. That's that's how you do it with a with the CSV model. OK. So and then you see we have our we have a curve for our data, which looks as expected high temperatures in the summer, low in the winter. OK. And you need to file OK. Let me see if I can post the filing the chat. Just give me a minute. OK. So you can know that the file from here. It's just some. It was 12 years of data from from temperature files random.
