The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture of Tobias Laemmle. Write a detailed summary about the given topics.

TRANSCRIPT:

Thank you. So. Hello everybody. Hello. Okay. microphones if you don't already have, so we don't have interruptions. So is everybody able to clearly see me and hear my voice? Yes. Okay. Perfect. Otherwise if I'm too, if you're not able to hear me clearly, I can use a microphone as well. Just hit me up in the chat if there's a, or occurs a problem or if there's maybe a problem with my internet connection. All right. So once again, hello everybody. My name is Tobias Lemle, but I know that's a complicated name, so really Tobias absolutely fine with me if that's all right for you. Once again, I'm very warm. Welcome to our introduction to machine-done course. And as you may have heard in the last couple minutes, I just found out about the feature and zoom of playing waiting music. And in case you were wondering about the song, well, there was my interpretation of Lady Gaga's poker face. And I have created it with a tool called MuseNet, which is an AI tool from Microsoft that lets you kind of compose music using artificial intelligence. So really cool. You can select the instruments and you can select a style played like Beethoven or Mozart or lots of other things. So as you can see and hear I'm pretty excited about AI in general, as this is really one of my favorite topics to talk about. And I really think it's such a great idea to give students like you no matter what you're studying or no matter what your major is or your background, a blowover view about this topic. As we all know, this will eventually become even more and more part of our everyday lives. So some organizational stuff before we get started. You already told me you can clearly hear and see me, so that's no problem. And as you might have guessed, this is a completely remote course. So please let me know if I'm going too fast, if I'm going too slow or if you need more breaks or less breaks or anything like that in that matter. And if there's questions that arise during the the lectures or if there's anything that's not clear in my slides, please let me know. I will try to answer the questions right here, maybe in the chat or maybe after that lectures. Or you can also write me an email or I think we have a message board in Blackboard 2. I will also post all the slides, all the exercises, all the sample data on Blackboards and I will try to do always a couple of days prior to the upcoming lectures I will try. So you can download it in advance and take a look at it. And of course, there will also be a recording of every lecture, just in case you missed it or maybe you have technical problems or maybe you just want to rewatch we watch the whole lecture. And I will post the link always afterwards, afterwards after each lecture and put the link on Blackboard 2. There will be lots of practical examples and exercises in our lectures where you can follow me along on your computer at home and I would highly recommend doing so. As you will quickly notice, everything in machine learning is way clearer if you do it rather than just hear me talking about it or seeing in the slides. And that also brings me to the next part which I'm pretty sure you're eager to hear will there be a test? No, there won't be a written test but of course you will get a grade. You will get a grade afterwards so we'll do a couple of assignments. I don't know how many maybe one or two maybe three and you sent me in your results and then you get a grade for these assignments and also there will be a pitch video at the end of our lecture. So the assignment the exercise the assignments will amount to 30% of your grade and the pitch video at the end is 70% off your grade. And I think we will do the pitch video as a group brock. However, everybody will be great at individually. The idea behind this is after this course you should have done like a basic understanding of what is capable of machine learning and what not. So you should come up with an idea a use case that could be improved using AI because this way you can show that you understood which areas of machine learning are a good fit and what algorithms do make sense in this kind of use case what kind of data you will need for that and so on. And the second benefit is of course the pitch itself because it is so valuable today not only to have like good ideas but also to be able to sell them and because I'm a big fan of bouncing ideas back and forth we will do this in a group of maybe two or three I don't know yet. So right now don't worry too much about the pitch we will get into that in more detail after our last lecture. So what else? We have a total of I think 10 different topics and I hope I really hope we get through all of them but it's a lot and I will rather alter the pace if we need to than just to speed through all the topics because as I said my goal is to get to a point where you get a basic understanding of machine learning in general because I guess most of you will eventually end up in some kind of leadership role and you will eventually get in touch with AI and machine learning in one way or the other. So for instance you probably get approached by by one of your data scientists or sales representatives and in such a case it really makes a difference when you when you basically understand what they are talking about and I don't mean you have to write algorithms or complicated pipe encodes for yourself but when somebody tells you maybe this model has an AUC of 0.9 you know that if that's good or bad and when you read that the model has been trained using a support vector machine you know that's a classification algorithm and it makes sense to use it in this case. So each new topic we will have we start with some theory and always follow up with a practical example where you see the algorithm we're talking about in action and where you see the problem at hand using real life data. So I guess some of the stuff is pretty straightforward because you may have already seen it in some math or statistic
