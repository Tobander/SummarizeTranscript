TRANSCRIPT:

great. The method is pretty straightforward. Like we did with the lines first. And we select the backend and make all the relevant imports. Then we create a curve using fake data. And we create our figure and access. And that's basically it. So. If you want to do a scatter block with way bigger points, then we have the s argument, which lets you set the size of the markers. The size is in points squared. Let's say if you want to mark over 10 points high, you choose s equals 100. Alright. So let's quickly head over to the editor and just write to plot some so big points. Okay. So. We can we can leave this all as before. We just create some values between minus one and one. And for the why values we use again, similar values, just use our x values. And again, the random normal distribution using the size. Of our x values. Alright. Then. We can draw a scatter plot using the x and y values. And. As I said, we want to have big, big points. So we go with 80 for the size. So the 10 is the default. So they will be they will be much bigger. And we save and. I'm saving it and my images all end. I don't know markers. underscore large. Okay. So. What did I forget? Oh. Thanks again. Okay. Very good. Okay. So. Just. So that you see these are supposed to be bigger. Because yeah, if I do a they're way smaller and we do one. 100. They're way bigger. So. So you can modify the size of all markers. But you're also able to modify every single marker you want. The way I did this was I just randomly assigned different sizes to. Different markers. Sometimes also. A circle just isn't enough. You want something different. And luckily, MAPLOWLIP has recovered there as well, because there are thousands of options. Plus the ability to create custom shapes if you want to. So you just use the marker argument and the right character code. I put up here some examples. You can choose whatever style you like. Comment. You want a point circle square triangle plus X. And so on. Also. Having differently state markers. Is very good if you want to distinguish between different groups of data. For instance, if your control group is is all circles and. You make your experimental group all access. And you can see the difference pops out into people who can't differentiate between colors. That's that's one benefit. And. There's. There's also the possibility to change the color of the markers as well. So right here we have a beautiful orange for the for the markers as well. If you want to get extra fancy. And you can control the color of each point, individual really like with the size. And this is what really makes the scatter function special. One way to go about this is to specify a set of numerical wallet values for the color. One for each data point. That's what I'm doing here. I'm just assigning some random numerical value to the color and met blood lip uses this number to just. And you use different colors for each new data point. Very, very easy, very convenient. This is particular useful when you have lots and lots of overlapping markers. And you would like to get a sense of their density to illustrate this. We need first to create a lot of data points. Then we can also use something like the alpha argument. And set it to something small. So each individual point only contributes to a small amount of digital ink to the picture. This way you can quickly see at one glance where there are lots of data points because that's where the result is the solid color. Alpha equals one represents no tearing no transparency and is always the default. So then we have also the edge color parameter, which is necessary to remove the markers outlines. For some marker types, at least the alpha argument doesn't apply to the outlines and only the solid color. But I will show you this in the example. And there are lots and lots of other fine details you can control. And if you curious again, just check out the API documentation. Good. I have provided some exercises for this too, but let's just move on to the. To the max slides and you can do the exercises combined with the third exercises. Okay. So the third part is. Unfortunately, text is one of the trivia things to get right on a plot because there are so many options and permutations. Anyone who's honest will tell you that they Google the syntax every time I'll do that too when doing my plot lips text for me. I can change that, but I at least want to give wanted to give you like a one stop shop where you can go back. And you if you need to search for where to put a text in your blood. So I just listed a couple of possibilities of text in a blood. For example, you can have labels. You can have arrows equations text in the box without a box. So even, yeah, even fancy fancy annotations. So what do we do first as usual, we need to set the stage by importing the relevant libraries and we need to create some fake data for the curve. And then we can set the x axis label the y axis label or title with these three functions here. I think the calls for doing this are fairly intuitive. So the style is pretty generic, but you'll get a chance to customize the style of the text later on. But for starters, I would say let's let's try to replicate this this image first. So going ahead back to spider and we'll try to do the axis labels and a title. All right. Let's do minus six till six and have a couple more values, let's say 500. And we just use the sync function with our x values. And then plot, plot it on screen. And then we set a label for x axis with the set x label. And let's call it, I don't know, the x axis label and we do the same for the y label. And also we want to have a title. So we use the set title method. And let's say this is the title. Simply last step is to save it in a file. So this is my title. Okay. So we see the title, we have an x label, x label and we have a y label. So I think at least that part is is pretty straightforward still. Anybody okay with that? So basically you can add any
