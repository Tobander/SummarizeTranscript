The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture of Tobias Laemmle. Write a detailed summary about the given topics.

TRANSCRIPT:

class and some of the stuff is not so easy to rest but first time you hear it like neural networks of course for example and that's why I would really suggest also we don't write a written test you maybe take a look at a second look at the slides after our lectures because that applies especially for neural networks and although this is no rocket science it gets so much clearer if you just take a second look at it and also also forget the most important part have fun with it. I know that sounds ridiculous but really there is so much really so much free data out there and basically and the basics you learn here are more than enough to play around with it to make predictions I don't know about the house prices in your area or what's the ideal time to get up in the morning to maximize sleep then but don't be late or and maybe I'll show you this at the end if we have time build an app that can recognize your face or your dog's face or vice face whatever you have trained it on so there are already so many tools also no code tools out there that will do the heavy coding for you so you don't have to do that you don't need to understand everything but you need to understand the basics first and that's our main goal in this course and this introduction to machine learning and just to give you a quick idea where I'm coming from so you know who's talking to you I've been up in studying business engineering then I could be worked in logistics then as a management consultant and finally I went into financial services so right now I'm working as a software architect in the compliance department of a financial services institution very focused mainly on anti-money laundering or short AML and fraud detection which is an area where AI will become more and more involved in the coming years so so right now we're doing a lot of projects a lot of studies or proof of concepts just to check how AI can help detect illegal transactions so that was how I got inspired and hooked on everything around machine learning and I hope I can pass some of that excitement at least some of it onto you so without further ado I would say we're going to start and I'm going to share my screen so you can see my slides and we'll do a quick introduction so if there's any problems just simply up in the chat but for now let's I'm going to share my screen all right perfect so I quickly pull up the chat just to see your questions okay everybody able to see this likes yes perfect all right so now I'm going to start with a restored short story and imagine it's a couple years back it's it's a hot summer evening in 2014 and Bishop Bond the girl on the right she was already late when she was picking up her friend and as they were walking down the sidewalk they noticed this old kick roll or leaning abandoned on the wall they don't really think about it but just pick it up and they try to roll the thing down the street which is actually for for small kids so suddenly a woman is shouting at them from her kitchen window hey that's my kids kick roll and leave that thing alone the girls immediately stop leaning the kickback roll lean the kick roller back against the wall and just keep walking down the street as if nothing happened what they did know a neighbor has already watched the whole scene and called the police so two blocks furthered on the road they stopped the two worlds and they arrested for bulgarian theft this was the first time Brisha got arrested in her life so in the summer the same year the 41-year old Brunan Prada the guy on the left he got arrested for breaking into a hardware store he has already served five years in jail for unrovery and attempted arm robbery so Prada looks like the typical repeat of fandom but surprisingly something very strange happens when they both got scored from an algorithm called compass on their probability to lapse back into crime so Borden who is black she gets an eight and Vernon who is white he gets a three so now eight years later we know that algorithm was completely wrong because Borden has never been arrested since then Prada on the other side is serving right now an eight-year sentence for breaking into a warehouse again so in the US the incarnation rate for Latin americans is three times as high and for after Americans six times as high as for white people and exactly for this reason many civil right movements have pointed out that because of discrimination in law enforcement the incarnation rate doesn't represent the actual crime rate and they demanded more objective non-discriminatory decision-making systems like this algorithm but now it looks like that this algorithm is even less objective it seems it did even amplify the discrimination so what happened I would like to show you with this and of course without the examis why AI and machine learning on one side have the potential to to do so much great stuff that will improve our everyday allies but it can also go sideways very very easily and that is exactly the reason why it is so important to give everybody at least a basic understanding of machine learning and the ability to questions or assess the results all right so let's take a more detailed look at this algorithm at compass and why it produced so confusing results in the first place so the model we're talking about it gets information about the past of criminals like how many times they've been arrested what crimes they have committed the age gender but also things like if their relatives have ever been arrested if their parents have been divorced and so on and then the model takes all this information and calculates a risk score similarly to let's say a car insurance where drivers with a high risk going to one group and drivers with a low risk going into the other but all drivers from the same group are treated equally so to do this the algorithm looks for characteristics that are in common with people who get arrested again and characteristics from people who become righteous


GIVEN TOPICS:

-The potential for machine learning to improve our everyday lives
-The potential for machine learning to go sideways
-The importance of giving everybody at least a basic understanding of machine learning
-How machine learning algorithms work
-The example of the Compass algorithm


DETAILED SUMMARY:


==========

Machine learning has the potential to improve our everyday lives in a number of ways, but it also has the potential to go sideways. It is therefore important to give everybody at least a basic understanding of machine learning.
