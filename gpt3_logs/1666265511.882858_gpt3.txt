TRANSCRIPT:

system which is a good thing and because you can create visualizations like this without anything knowing about pipeline at all. So for the most common tasks it just gives a convenient set of commands which we can take advantage of. So let as I said I quickly introduce the commands like this and then we will write the actual code which is exactly what you see on screen. Inspire. So the first thing we do is we import numpy numpy is a if you haven't used it before it's just a numerical processing library which is great for working with data of any sort as we need to create some test data to visualize. So and the second part is we have to import pipeline. The most common thing in map plot lib is basically to plot a line. But in order to do so we have to create a line first and to create a line we need some x values and we need some y values and for the x values we use numpy's Lin space function which you see here. The Lin space function basically has two parameters. Don't worry this this is just to create data the first one is the starting point and the second one is the end point and the third one is optional is how many values we want to create. So basically this line is telling you hey I want to have 500 values and these values should be between minus two times p and two times p. So that's it and then we need to create the y values which uses the numpy sing function using our just created x values. Alright so we then we have to do this the first time initialize a figure because we need a figure to plot. Then we hand over our just created values and finally we show this plot on screen and basically that's it it should look. Sorry. It should look something like this. So you see the best thing about map is how it's really like common tasks because once we had our data which was the main part it then only took three lines of code to make this plot. So we are all set so let's try this on our own and again just follow me along as I'm writing the code with me and then maybe we have some a couple of minutes replicated on your own computer if you want to. So I'm going to head over to the editor and I hope you'll see it. Okay so right now we the editor. I guess it's pretty small so let's let me try to zoom in a little bit and you tell me when it's good. Is that fine? Yes it's good now. Okay just tell me if it's if it's too small and then we can zoom in a little bit more. Yes that's spider if you haven't seen it. The great thing or why I'm using spider here is because it very conveniently shows the plot here down here right in a console and also you can. You can see your files on your computer here as well and it shows all the variables you create here but we will see that in a minute. So first thing to do we just write the code I just we just saw on the on the slides so first I'm going to import numpy. So I'll give you a couple of minutes when I'm if I'm typing too fast okay so then we import high plot. And then we need our x values using num pies a list based function and we've used two times p and minus two times p. And we want to have 500 evenly distributed values and then we create the by values using some place sing function handing over just created x values. So then first time we need to initialize the figure we're going to plot and hand over our values to the plot function so x and y. And last thing we want to do is show it on screen. Alright so if I'm executing this you see it's pretty conveniently just see it on on the screen and also you inspired you can see it here and a little bit bigger in the in the plots pane. So let me know if it works for you or if you have any problems running this this code or questions about any of the functions used. Or just tell me if it's working. Yeah I do have a question for a couple of functions that we used if I can. One is what is actually the sync function doing. We want to you see that's like a curve sinus curve and to do that we need a need a function that is. Yeah that will create those those y values for us it's it's nothing it has nothing to do with my plot lip it's just because I wanted to draw something like a side the sinus curve and you can do that with the sync function. Okay okay thanks and then also why we I mean what are we doing in when we write the first time like figure PLT figure why it's like he has no input. It's just the figure is here the plot we drew here and if you wanted the first time that's called initialization you need to analyze the figure it's it's like. The ground where you want to paint where you can paint something something okay but we will I have I think one or one or two slides on this in. A couple slides slides on well I will we will take a look into figure but as far as as far as this goes you just need to initialize is the first time yeah. And then you can use the plot functions to draw a figure. Okay yes thanks okay so you see that was a pretty quick as I said most of the time most of our time went into producing the values which you normally don't have to because you have data but we need to create some fake data but then it's it's just three lines of code so. Now I will go back to the slides I hope that's okay for because we we jump pretty much back and forth between slides and exercises I hope that's alright if that's too complicated just tell me and. We'll first do the theory and then we write the code but I think it's more practical if you see the theory and then right afterwards we write the code just let me know. Okay so. The second most common plotting task is to show points in a in a scatter plot and this is streamlined to in that plot clip first step again we create some fake data this time using the random function and we create some evenly spaced X values between minus one and one you see now I didn't write how many values I want to. Create and the default value is 15 so now we don't create 500 we create just 50 values all between minus one and one. And we make some why values that are similar to X
