The following is an unstructured video transcript of a machine-learning lecture of Tobias Laemmle. Write a detailed summary about the given topics.

TRANSCRIPT:

exactly why it is so difficult to buy systems with already pre-trained models it's simply unlikely that the model has been trained for exactly that quality measure that is right for your situation or for your company however that's not always the case for use cases like let's say facial recognition it absolutely makes sense to profit from pre-trained systems for use cases or lots of other use cases like that but maybe think about fall recognition where you have different writings and different languages like the one at the seven at U.S. and likely write it in Europe but for something like choosing the right hiring candidates where every company has different requirements it really doesn't make any sense at all so it's very important to not let a data scientist alone choose a quality measure is even more important not to forget that with every quality measure you choose you're always making decisions that can affect people's life and I that's my personal opinion but I think that is probably the most important aspect about machine learning at all so therefore let's take a look at some let's say moral dilemmas the mitochondria and how this can eventually lead to something like discrimination for example so better our case of pressure born the girl that has been classified with a high risk of relapsing back into crime from an algorithm how would you decide if you were the one in charge for training the responsible support rectum machine how would you optimize your model we have again our 27 data points but this time with a totally different meaning imagine it is possible to find out I don't know what genetic tests is someone is born good or evil how would you draw the line this time to classify new criminal offenders remember these are the exact same data points but thus the context the decision you have to make change the way you draw the line because somebody who is worried about the possibility that there are people out there who can get away with crimes which shows a totally different quality measure than someone who is way more worried about the chance that there are innocent people who have to go to jail all right so once again same data points try to draw a line and if you are a couple minutes and then let's see how many of you didn't send somebody innocent to prison honor All right. I'm just guessing, but I think I'm guessing maybe you draw the line. You drew the line different now. Just some lines from me for comparison. Take a look at this. So the red line is clearly somebody who wants every offender to go to jail. The green one, Dolos, she wants to make sure knowing some people have to go to jail ever. And the orange one would be somewhere in between those two. So you'll see the decision for a quality measure is always also a model decision, a decision about which error has the bigger consequences for you. To make that even more clear, let's take a look at a potential machine learning use case where the consequences for error are really fatal. I don't know if anybody has seen this picture before. Does anybody recognize this picture or what it should represent? It's a yes. Okay. Oh, quite a lot. Okay. So I guess you know the model dilemma of this. It's called the trolley problem. And it's a moral thought experiment. We have a appointment who can prevent a fatal collision that would cost five people's life, the five people on top. However, to do this, he has to sacrifice the life of this one man down here. And every data scientist that is training machine learning models for autonomous driving has to face exactly this dilemma. The dilemma of deciding which error has the bigger consequences. Now a really drastic example of that. So there were people at MIT that have asked exactly that question. And they built what is called a moral machine, an application that shows different scenarios to see how people react and how people decide. And don't get me wrong. This isn't supposed to make fun or played like a game. But if autonomous driving should be real someday, you have to think about these kind of decisions. And the scenario is always like this. It's going to have an accident, no matter what. But you have to decide what if it should keep going or if it should make a turn. And I'll show you examples, but you can drive it out of yourself in the next break if you'd like to. And I will put up a link to the to the ad. So here's an example of an autonomous vehicle. So nobody's sitting behind the wheels. And in the first case, you are going to hit one female, two male and two female executives. And in the second case, you're going to hit four homeless people and one female. So it's up to you to decide. And if you open up the app, you just click on one of these scenarios and at the end, you get an evaluation of what kind of a decision-making you are. So one was like, here, this is not an autonomous vehicle, but there are three people, four people illegally crossing the street, which you can see because the traffic light is red when they're crossing the street. And it is one female doctor, one overweight woman, one female athlete and one female executives. And on the other side, in the car, are sitting one female doctor, one overweight woman, one female athlete, one female executives and one young boy. So again, this isn't supposed to be fun, but it's hard to make those kinds of decisions. So you see the application of machine learning to an existing problem isn't so straightforward at all. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered before. And but on the other hand, there are already lots of great use cases. Where the use of machine learning is a great benefit. And it makes our lives easier. So for example, everybody knows that has a smartphone, how good Face ID is working. For example, there are also numerous examples of document ahead, writing recognition, like in logistics or in financial services. Basically, you can say machine learning can be very successful when the following


GIVEN TOPICS:

1. The difficulty of using pre-trained machine learning models.
2. The importance of choosing the right quality measure.
3. The moral dilemma of the trolley problem.
4. The benefits of machine learning in various fields.


DETAILED SUMMARY:


==========

1. It is difficult to use pre-trained machine learning models because it is unlikely that the model has been trained for the specific quality measure that is needed for the situation.
2. It is important to choose the right quality measure when training machine learning models because the decision can affect people's lives.
3. The trolley problem is a moral dilemma that autonomous driving data scientists have to face when deciding which error to avoid.
4. Machine learning can be beneficial in various fields, such as facial recognition and document writing recognition.
